# Uplink

"The missing link between desktop and phone."  
Very experimental software for emailing yourself things for communication between devices..  

To add something, email yourself the subject `[Uplink, at (DATE)]`.  
An example of this is `[Uplink, at Jul 30, 2023, 12:00 AM]`.  

The content can be anything.  
My default settings in `config.json.default` work for iCloud, using IMAP.  
`header_end` is the average line where headers usually end, for me it's 52 and will most likely vary for others.
